    <p>
    For more than five years, I've been teaching yoga. Yoga Teacher Training can be quite expensive and it came to my attention that I was actually spending more money on training than I was earning.
    While I still love yoga and will continue to teach, I'm learning to develop so I can not only continue to be creative but also contribute financially to my family.
    Additionally, I will be able to use the skills that I learn here will help me reach more people with my yoga, perhaps by building a site where I can offer classes online.
    I've always enjoyed working with computers; I took a few classes in graphic design while in college.
    I think learning to write code opens up doors I cannot even imagine at this point.
