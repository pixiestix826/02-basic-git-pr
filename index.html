      For the past five years, I've been teaching yoga full time.  I found that I spent more money in training than I actually earned.
      While I still love teaching and will continue to teach, I'm learning to develop so I can continue to be creative but also contribute financially to my family.
      Additionally, I will be able to use the skills that I learn here will help me reach more people with my yoga, perhaps by building a site where I can offer classes online.
      I've always enjoyed working with computers and think learning to write code opens up doors I cannot even imagine at this point.
